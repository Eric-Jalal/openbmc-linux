config SOC_ASPEED
	def_bool y
	depends on ARCH_ASPEED || COMPILE_TEST

config ASPEED_LPC_CTRL
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC to BMC bridge control"
	help
	  Control Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST LPC to BMC mappings through
	  ioctl()s, the driver also provides a read/write interface to a BMC ram
	  region where the host LPC read/write region can be buffered.

config ASPEED_LPC_SNOOP
	tristate "Aspeed ast2500 HOST LPC snoop support"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC snoop interface which
	  allows the BMC to listen on and save the data written by
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_P2A_CTRL
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	tristate "Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC bridge control"
	help
	  Control Aspeed ast2400/2500 HOST P2A VGA MMIO to BMC mappings through
	  ioctl()s, the driver also provides an interface for userspace mappings to
	  a pre-defined region.

config ASPEED_XDMA
	tristate "Aspeed XDMA Engine Driver"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed XDMA Engine found on the Aspeed AST2XXX
	  SOCs. The XDMA engine can perform automatic PCI DMA operations
	  between the AST2XXX (acting as a BMC) and a host processor.

config ASPEED_ESPI
	tristate "Aspeed eSPI Engine Driver"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed eSPI engine. The eSPI engine
	  plays as a slave device in BMC to communicate with the host
	  side master over the eSPI interface. The four eSPI channels,
	  namely peripheral, virtual wire, out-of-band, and flash are
	  supported.

config ASPEED_ESPI_MMBI
	tristate "Aspeed eSPI MMBI Driver"
	depends on ASPEED_ESPI
	help
	  Control Aspeed eSPI MMBI driver

config ASPEED_UDMA
	tristate "Aspeed UDMA Engine Driver"
	depends on ARCH_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON && HAS_DMA
	help
	  Enable support for the Aspeed UDMA Engine found on the Aspeed AST2XXX
	  SOCs. The UDMA engine can perform UART DMA operations between the memory
	  buffer and the UART/VUART devices.

config ASPEED_UART_ROUTING
	tristate "Aspeed UART routing control"
	help
	  Control Aspeed UART routing via sysfs. This enables UART
	  and I/O components to be dynamically connected at runtime.

config ASPEED_LPC_PCC
	tristate "Aspeed Post Code Capture support"
	depends on SOC_ASPEED && REGMAP && MFD_SYSCON
	help
	  Provides a driver to control the LPC PCC interface,
	  allowing the BMC to snoop data bytes written by the
	  the host to an arbitrary LPC I/O port.

config ASPEED_OTP
	tristate "Aspeed OTP Driver"
	depends on MACH_ASPEED_G6
